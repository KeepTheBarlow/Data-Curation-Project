# Data-Curation-Project

This repository contains a scraped dataset from multiple Sports References pages that includes all active NCAA Men's Basketball teams. The dataset has all-time stats as well as stats from the most recent season. The code attempts to answer the questions: What statistics influence winning the most season to season and is there relative parity in college basketball, or do the same teams continue winning?

Graphs include correlation heatmap, scatterplots, bar charts, and histograms.
